        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <h2>Basics and History</h2>
        <p> Zero Knowledge Proofs were first introduced by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali and Charles Rackoff in the late 80’s. 
          In [GMR89], they created a new proving procedure with an efficient method for communicating a proof, or in modern terms, 
          an interactive proof system with an efficient verifier. An interactive proof is an interactive process in which a prover 
          probabilistically convinces a verifier of the correctness of a non-trivial mathematical proposition with overwhelming probability. 
          Furthermore, they made this proof zero-knowledge, meaning the verifier can learn nothing but the correctness of the proposition,
          and hence introducing the concept of knowledge complexity. In 2012, Shafi and Silvio received the A.M. Turing Award 
          “for transformative work that laid the complexity-theoretic foundations for the science of cryptography”.</p>

        <p>This work initiated a chain of theoretical results that framed our understanding of ZK proofs today. 
            Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson showed in [GMW86] that, assuming one-way functions, every problem in NP has a zero-knowledge proof. 
            This result was followed by [IY87] and [Ben-Or et al.] who demonstrated that anything that is provable by a proving system 
            can be proved in zero-knowledge</p>
          
        <p>  A second line of work derived into the study of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, which is a variant of the above, 
          except that there is no interaction between the prover and the verifier. 
          Interestingly, after the impossibility result for one shot zero-knowledge protocols in the standard model by Goldreich and Oren in [GO92], 
          it was understood that some cryptographic tasks may require proof systems in extended models.</p>
        <h2>Formal Security</h2>
        
        <h2>zk-SNARK</h2>
        <p> A zkSNARK is a variant of a zero-knowledge proof that enables a prover to succinctly convince any verifier of the validity 
          of a given statement and achieves computational zero-knowledge without requiring interaction between the prover and any verifier.</p>
