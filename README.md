ZKProof Standards Website

ZKProof.org is an open initiative of industry and academia to standardize the use of zero knowledge proofs. We are planning several workshops to standardize the security, implementation, applications and all other related aspects of this technology. The first workshop will take place in Boston in mid May and will bring together for the first time academic and industry experts in the field.
